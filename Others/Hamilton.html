<p>Hamilton is a hip-hop musical written by Lin Manuel Miranda. It portrays the life of American Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, inspired by Ron Chernow's biography of him.
    The musical was first perfromed in 2015 and was widely loved since then, having won numerous awards. It's known for its iconic music and lyrics, having the entire soundtrack composed of 46 songs, along with its diverse cast.
</p>
<p>I was first introduced to Hamilton during early 2025, which became a gateway to my love for musicals. I enjoyed watching animatics and listening to the deleted tracks, which gave much more life and depth to the story and characters.
    This musical was also what sparked my interest in American history."
